1. Prerequisites

  - g++ 4.7 or higher
  - CUDA Toolkit 7.0 or higher
  - GNU Autotools (only if you need to re-configure libfractal)
  - NVIDIA GPU with Fermi architecture or higher



2. Quick start guide

  2.1. Install libfractal (local)

    - Generate libfractal library files in build/lib/
    - Generate libfractal header files in build/include/fractal/

    $ ./build-local.sh

    TROUBLESHOOTING: aclocal version mismatch
      (Required: GNU Autotools)
      $ cd libfractal
      $ ./autoreconf


  2.2. Compile and run "movingAverage" example

    - Compute the moving average of recent 10 binary input values

    $ cd example/movingAverage/src
    $ make
    $ cd ../run
    $ ./run.sh


  2.3. Compile and run "languageModel" example

    - Learn plain text for character-level language modeling
    - Compute P(x_{t+1} | x_{1:t})
    - Can be run as a generative model

    $ cd example/languageModel/src
    $ make
    $ cd ../run
    $ ./train_wiki.sh

    After or during the training, we can test the generative model by

    $ ./textGen.sh



3. Install libfractal (global)

  - Install libfractal in the global zone (e.g. /usr/local/lib/, /usr/local/include/)

  $ cd libfractal
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ ../configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install



4. How to use the library

  - Include the Fractal header file in your C++ source code:
    #include <fractal/fractal.h>

  - Currently, you need to specify where the CUDA include directory is:
    $ g++ -o foo.o -c foo.cpp -I/usr/local/cuda/include

  - Link with -lfractal:
    $ g++ -o foo foo.o -lfractal
